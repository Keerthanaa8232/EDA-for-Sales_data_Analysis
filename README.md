🧾 SALES DATA ANALYSIS

OVERVIEW

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a sales dataset to uncover business insights such as:
1. The best month for sale
2.  Top-performing cities
3.   Most sold products
And various factors influencing sales performance.
The goal is to extract meaningful patterns and help businesses make data-driven decisions.

1. Python
2. Pandas, NumPy
3. Matplotlib, Seaborn
4. PyArrow
5. Jupyter Notebook

📊 KEY ANALYSIS PERFORMED

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Handled missing and duplicate values
3. Converted data types for consistency
4. Monthly Sales Analysis
5. Identified which month generated the highest sales revenue
6. City-Wise Sales Insights
7. Determined which cities recorded the most orders
8. Product Performance
9. Analyzed which products sold the most and why
10. Revenue Trends
11. Studied the relationship between quantity ordered, price, and revenue


📈 VISUALIZATION
Includes several visualizations such as:
1. Monthly revenue trends
2. City-wise order counts
3. Top-selling products chart
4. Trend of Most Sold product
5. Products that are often sold together
(All visualizations created using Matplotlib and Seaborn.)


🧮 PROJECT WORKFLOW

1. Import and clean the dataset
2. Perform EDA using Pandas and visualization libraries
3. Draw insights from the data
4. Conclude with actionable findings



🧠 KEY INSIGHTS FROM SALES DATA ANALYSIS

1. Best Month for Sales
December recorded the highest sales revenue, with a noticeable spike in order volume.
This aligns with holiday shopping trends and year-end discounts.
Recommendation: Increase advertising and inventory in December to maximize revenue.

2. Top Cities by Orders
San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City ranked as the top three cities in terms of total orders and revenue.
Urban centers show higher purchasing power and demand consistency.
Recommendation: Focus marketing efforts and delivery efficiency in these regions.

3. Most Profitable Products
Low-cost accessories led the volume of sales, notably the USB-C Charging Cable and Lightning Charging Cable, due to their affordability and necessity.

4. Relationship Between Quantity Ordered & Revenue
There is a negative correlation between the price of items and the number of units sold—lower-priced products sold in much higher quantities.

5. Product Category Trends
Electronics consistently dominated sales, especially during discount seasons.
Accessories like Headphones and Charging Cables were often purchased along with main devices.
